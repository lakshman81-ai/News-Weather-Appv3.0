* PCF RESTRAINT MAPPING FILE
*
* Follow the instructions below to define/modify the mapping file to meet your requirements as you import *.pcf files into CAESAR II.
* Lines starting with "*" may be used to insert comments.
*
* KEYWORD MAPPING SECTION
*********************************************
*
* Define a property from your PCF file to associate with the following CAESAR II keyword.
* The CAESAR II keywords located within "<>" are used in the PCF import process.
* The <SUPPORT_NAME> keyword is used by CAESAR II to map the supports.
* The <SUPPORT_GUID> and <SUPPORT_TAG> keywords are support properties that are imported into CAESAR II.
*
*
<SUPPORT_NAME> Name
<SUPPORT_TAG>  Name
<SUPPORT_GUID> UCI

*
* SUPPORT MAPPING SECTION
*********************************************
* The first line of each entry is the PCF property that is mapped to the <SUPPORT_NAME>,
* followed by the number of CAESAR II restraints it generates.
* THe next couple of lines define the CAESAR II restraint type, 1 per line.
* Valid entries are: ANC, VERT, NS, EW, A, B, C (these 3 also accept + or -), GUI, LIM, VHGR, CHGR
* VERT, NS, EW indicate absolute global axes.
* Local axes are indicated by a, b, c, (a = pipe centerline, b = support direction, c = a x (cross) b).
*
* Other supported keywords:
*   MU=x.xx
*   GAP=x.xx UN
*
* For best results, the <SUPPORT_NAME> keywords should be listed in order from longest to shortest.
* For example, list "VG100" before "VG1".
